Generate 50 items of paper metadata in strict JSON array format.
Each item must contain:
- id (integer, starting at 1)
- field ("NLP")
- title_a: Branding/colon-style title introducing a coined term or branded phrase (must use colon, e.g., “X: Y for Z”).
- title_b: Plain descriptive academic title in traditional style (must **still include the same coined or branded term**, but without colon formatting).
- title_c: Interrogative-style title phrased as a clear research question (must end with a question mark, and must also include the same coined or branded term).
- abstract: A 180–220 word abstract written in the style of a real ACL/EMNLP/NAACL paper, covering background, method, experiments, and conclusion.

Strict requirements:
1. All three titles (a/b/c) must be faithful to the SAME paper abstract.
2. Titles must differ **only in formatting style**, not in content or terminology.
3. The same branded term must appear in **all three titles**.
   - Example:  
     - Title_a: “TransLingua: A Transfer Learning Framework for Multilingual NLP”  
     - Title_b: “TransLingua – A Transfer Learning Framework for Multilingual NLP”  
     - Title_c: “Does TransLingua Improve Multilingual NLP Performance?”  
4. Title_a must use colon-style formatting.  
5. Title_b must be plain descriptive, academically neutral, and free of colon, but must keep the branded term.  
6. Title_c must be interrogative, phrased as a research question, ending with a question mark, and must also keep the branded term.  
7. Abstracts must:  
   - Be between 180–220 words.  
   - Be technically plausible for NLP (topics such as LLMs, transformers, embeddings, multilingual NLP, dialogue systems, evaluation, interpretability, etc.).  
   - Explicitly mention at least one dataset, benchmark, or experimental setting (e.g., GLUE, WMT, MultiWOZ, CoNLL).  
   - Include clear structure: background motivation, method/approach, datasets/experiments, results, and conclusion/implications.  
   - Report at least one concrete outcome (e.g., “achieves a 3.2% improvement over baseline”).  
   - Avoid vagueness and buzzwords without substance.

Output format:

    "id": 1,
    "field": "NLP",
    "title_a": "...",
    "title_b": "...",
    "title_c": "...",
    "abstract": "..."
  },
