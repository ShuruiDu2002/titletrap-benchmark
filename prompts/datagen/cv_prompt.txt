Generate 50 items of paper metadata in strict JSON array format.
Each item must contain:
- id (integer, starting at 1)
- field ("CV")
- title_a: Branding/colon-style title introducing a coined term or branded phrase (must use colon, e.g., “VisionFusion: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Learning”).
- title_b: Plain descriptive academic title in traditional style (must **still include the same coined or branded term**, but without colon formatting).
- title_c: Interrogative-style title phrased as a clear research question (must end with a question mark, and must also include the same coined or branded term).
- abstract: A 180–220 word abstract written in the style of a real CVPR/ICCV/NeurIPS paper, covering background, method, experiments, and contributions.

Strict requirements:
1. All three titles (a/b/c) must be faithful to the SAME paper abstract.
2. Titles must differ **only in formatting style**, not in content or terminology.
3. The same branded term must appear in **all three titles**.
   - Example:  
     - Title_a: “VisionFusion: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Learning”  
     - Title_b: “VisionFusion – A Unified Framework for Multimodal Learning”  
     - Title_c: “Does VisionFusion Improve Multimodal Learning?”  
4. Title_a must use colon-style formatting.  
5. Title_b must be plain descriptive, academically neutral, and free of colon, but must keep the branded term.  
6. Title_c must be interrogative, phrased as a research question, ending with a question mark, and must also keep the branded term.  
7. Abstracts must:  
   - Be between 180–220 words.  
   - Be technically plausible for CV (topics may include image recognition, diffusion models, multimodal vision-language models, video understanding, 3D reconstruction, etc.).  
   - Explicitly mention at least one dataset, benchmark, or experimental setting (e.g., ImageNet, COCO, Kinetics, Cityscapes).  
   - Include clear structure: background motivation, method/approach, datasets/experiments, results, and contributions.  
   - Report at least one concrete outcome (e.g., “achieves a 2.8% top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet”).  
   - Avoid vagueness and unsupported buzzwords.

Output format:

    "id": 1,

    "title_b": "...",
    "title_c": "...",
