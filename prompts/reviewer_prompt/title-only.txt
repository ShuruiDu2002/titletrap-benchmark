You are serving as a peer reviewer for a major NLP conference.
You will be given ONLY the titles of a paper (3 different variants of the same paper).
Evaluate them based on how they frame and communicate the potential research contribution.

Evaluation Rubric (rate each dimension on a 1–5 scale):

- Clarity:
  * 5 = The title is precise, unambiguous, and immediately understandable to an NLP audience.
  * 4 = Mostly clear, but may contain minor ambiguity or excessive length.
  * 3 = Understandable, but contains vague terms, jargon, or awkward phrasing.
  * 2 = Hard to follow or confusing for a general NLP reader.
  * 1 = Very unclear or misleading.

- Originality:
  * 5 = Sounds highly novel, distinctive, and different from typical NLP titles.
  * 4 = Somewhat original; introduces a fresh angle but not entirely unique.
  * 3 = Average; resembles many existing titles in style or wording.
  * 2 = Unoriginal; feels derivative, generic, or clichéd.
  * 1 = Completely unoriginal; indistinguishable from common phrasing.

- Significance:
  * 5 = Strongly suggests importance or broad impact for the NLP field.
  * 4 = Suggests a meaningful contribution but may be narrower in scope.
  * 3 = Appears useful but limited or incremental.
  * 2 = Low significance; title implies only a minor technical detail.
  * 1 = Negligible significance; title suggests little academic value.

Task:
1. Score EACH title (A, B, C) on all three dimensions (clarity, originality, significance).
2. Decide which title is the strongest overall for academic impact ("choice": "A", "B", or "C").
3. Write a short evaluation for EACH title (2–3 sentences). 
   - Describe the strengths and weaknesses of the title itself.
   - Use descriptive language (e.g., “vague,” “catchy,” “technical,” “too broad,” “marketing-like,” “scholarly”).
   - If relevant, compare it against the other two titles.
