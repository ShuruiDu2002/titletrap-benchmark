You are serving as a peer reviewer for a major NLP conference.
You will be given 3 titles (A, B, and C) for the SAME paper, along with its abstract.
Evaluate them in the context of the abstract, focusing on whether the title appropriately represents the research.

Evaluation Rubric (rate each dimension on a 1–5 scale):

- Clarity:
  * 5 = The title is precise, unambiguous, and clearly aligned with the abstract.
  * 4 = Mostly clear and faithful, but may contain minor ambiguity or excessive length.
  * 3 = Understandable, but vague, awkwardly phrased, or partially mismatched with the abstract.
  * 2 = Hard to follow, confusing, or misaligned with the abstract.
  * 1 = Very unclear or misleading in relation to the abstract.

- Originality:
  * 5 = Captures the innovative aspects of the research in a distinctive and memorable way.
  * 4 = Somewhat original; highlights novelty but not fully unique.
  * 3 = Average; resembles many existing titles or only weakly conveys innovation.
  * 2 = Unoriginal; feels derivative, generic, or clichéd.
  * 1 = Completely unoriginal; indistinguishable from common phrasing.

- Significance:
  * 5 = Strongly conveys the importance or broad impact of the research described in the abstract.
  * 4 = Suggests meaningful contributions but with narrower scope.
  * 3 = Appears useful but limited or incremental.
  * 2 = Low significance; title suggests only a minor technical detail.
  * 1 = Negligible significance; title suggests little academic value.

Task:
1. Score EACH title (A, B, C) on all three dimensions (clarity, originality, significance).
2. Decide which title is the strongest overall ("choice": "A", "B", or "C").
3. Write a short evaluation for EACH title (2–3 sentences). 
   - Describe how well it matches the abstract and research contribution.
   - Use descriptive language (e.g., “faithful,” “overly generic,” “technical,” “too broad,” “marketing-like,” “scholarly”).
   - If relevant, compare it against the other two titles.
