    "reasons": {
      "A": "Title A is clear and directly aligned with the abstract, effectively conveying the purpose of PhraseGenerator in creative writing. It is somewhat original, though it lacks a distinctive flair. The title suggests a meaningful contribution to the field, but it does not emphasize the impact as strongly as Title C.",
      "B": "Title B is awkwardly phrased and somewhat redundant, making it less clear than Title A. It lacks originality, as it closely resembles Title A without adding any new perspective. The significance is not well conveyed, as the title feels more like a technical description than a statement of impact.",
      "C": "Title C is clear and poses an engaging question that aligns well with the abstract's focus on evaluating PhraseGenerator's effectiveness. It is highly original, capturing the innovative aspect of the research in a memorable way. The title strongly conveys the significance of the research by highlighting its potential impact on creative writing, making it the strongest choice overall."
