      "B": "Title B is less clear due to its awkward phrasing and redundancy, which makes it harder to follow. It is also unoriginal and suggests low significance, as it feels generic and does not imply a meaningful contribution. Overall, it is the weakest of the three titles.",
      "C": "Title C is mostly clear and introduces a fresh angle by posing a question, which adds originality and suggests a focus on evaluating impact. It implies a more significant contribution by addressing the effectiveness of the tool, making it more engaging and impactful than the other titles. This makes it the strongest choice overall."
