      "A": "Title A precisely names the specific model introduced in the paper (FeedbackLoop) while clearly indicating its purpose for continuous learning in NLP, perfectly aligning with the abstract's focus. It is scholarly, informative, and directly references the novel contribution described in the abstract, making it immediately clear what the research contributes to the field.",
      "B": "Title B is overly generic and lacks the specific model name (FeedbackLoop) that is central to the paper's contribution. While technically accurate, it fails to differentiate this work from other continuous learning research in NLP and doesn't capture the innovative aspect of the proposed model that the abstract emphasizes.",
      "C": "Title C poses a question rather than stating the contribution, making it less direct though still related to the abstract's content. While it addresses the topic area, it doesn't specifically mention the FeedbackLoop model that constitutes the paper's main contribution, and the question format feels less scholarly and more conversational than would be expected for this research."
