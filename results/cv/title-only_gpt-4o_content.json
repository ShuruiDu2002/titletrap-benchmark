      "A": "Title A, 'ConnectNet: Enhancing Connectivity in IoT Networks,' is mostly clear and introduces a specific term, 'ConnectNet,' which suggests a novel approach or model. It is somewhat original due to the coined term, which adds a distinctive touch. The title implies a significant contribution to the field of IoT connectivity, making it potentially impactful.",
      "B": "Title B, 'Enhancing Connectivity in IoT Networks,' is very clear and straightforward, but lacks originality as it is quite generic and resembles many existing titles. While it suggests a useful contribution, it does not imply a broad impact or novel approach, making it less significant compared to the other titles.",
      "C": "Title C, 'How Can AI Enhance Connectivity in IoT Networks?' is clear but slightly less so due to its question format, which can be seen as less direct. It introduces the angle of AI, which adds some originality, but the phrasing is not as distinctive as Title A. The title suggests a significant contribution by involving AI, but the question format may imply a more exploratory rather than definitive study."
